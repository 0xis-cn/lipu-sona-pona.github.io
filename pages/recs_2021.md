jan Lentan wrote a list of recommended websites in April 2020--May 2021.
The community has changed significantly since then, so most of them are not
currently relevant to show on the front page, and required a complete rewrite.
However I felt like it would be best to keep the list intact for as a piece of
community legacy from that era, for those who like that kind of stuff.

## Software

Here are links to some software that I personally found useful:

* ["ding" dictionary tool](http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding/) is a
simple-looking and easy to use dictionary tool that, by default, comes bundled
with German-to-English dictionaries, but toki pona-to-English files for it are
also available [on this
page](https://jan-lope.github.io/Toki_Pona_lessons_English/).

* [toki pona keyboard](https://github.com/timeopochin/tokiponakeyboard) for
  Android phones. Supports both Latin (with some sitelen pona font features) and
  sitelen emoji. (WIP)

* [ilo pi sitelen pona](https://ilo-pi-sitelen-pona.glitch.me/): a web-based
  tool that converts Latin-based toki pona into UCSUR-compatible sitelen pona.

## Other courses online

* [Jonathan Gabel's lessons](https://jonathangabel.com/toki-pona) teach both
  toki pona as a language and "sitelen sitelen", a rather ornamental-looking (if
  uncommon in general usage) writing system for toki pona.
