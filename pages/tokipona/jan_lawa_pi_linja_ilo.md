# what's it about?

This is a translation of the public domain homebrew game "LAN Master" by
[Shiru](http://shiru.untergrund.net/) that changes all of the text in game into
sitelen pona.

# what's "lan master"

"LAN Master" is a puzzle game, in which your goal is to connect all of the
computers with pipe-like cables. You can rotate any piece of cable, and whenever
the cables form an unbroken connection between all the machines, the level is
over. However, the game has a time limit, and on later stages, random
connections may "break" and rotate themselves. The idea is similar to an old
game called "NetWalk", but unlike "NetWalk", there is no central "server" that
all computers must be connected to.

# why translate an nes game?

The now-retired toki pona pages by jan Pije offered a bunch of toki pona translation ROM
hacks for old games, and to sort of honor jan Pije's contributions, I decided to
try and make my own translation hack. Except in this case, the game is
public-domain and open-source, which means there are no copyright issues with
hosting the game.
