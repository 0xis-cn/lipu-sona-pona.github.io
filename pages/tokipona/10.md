## Pre-verbs

Time to cover the last grammatical feature of toki pona: pre-verbs. These are
words that are added before other verbs and modify their meaning.

The word "kama" is used both as a regular verb to mean "to come" and to express
that something is a current event:

> mi jo e moku. -- I have food.
>
> mi kama jo e moku. -- I (got / am getting) food.

> mi kama tan ma Losi -- I come from Russia.

As a pre-verb, the word "ken" functions much like the English word "can":

> mi pali e tomo. -- I work on a house.
>
> mi ken pali e tomo. -- I can work on a house.

It can be used on its own to mean "possibility", "ability":

> ni li ken. -- This is possible.

> ken la ale li pona. -- Maybe everything is okay.

The words "open" and "pini" express that the action is beginning or ending.

> mi open pali e tomo. -- I start working on a house.

> mi pini pali e tomo. -- I finish working on a house.

The word "sona" by itself can mean "knowledge" or "to know", but as a pre-verb,
it means "know how to [do the action]":

> mi sona pali e tomo. -- I know how to work on a house.

> mi sona e ni. -- I know this.

> mi sona sitelen. -- I know how to write/draw.

> mi sona e sitelen. - I know a writing/picture.

When "kama" is added before "sona", you get a phrase that means "to learn":

> mi kama sona toki kepeken toki pona. -- I am learning how to speak toki pona.

The word "wile" is used to express want or need for the following action.

> jan lili li wile moku. -- The child (is hungry / wants to eat).

> jan lili li wile e ijo musi. The child wants a toy (amusing thing).

> wile sina li suli mute. -- Your needs/desires are very big.

## Time

The word "tenpo" is useful, because it's at the basis of many phrases that allow
one to define time at which something is happening. Since toki pona doesn't have
grammatical tenses, the way time is generally described is by using an
additional phrase:

> tenpo ni la mi moku. -- (Right now, ) I eat.

or 

> mi moku lon tenpo ni. -- I eat (at this time).

The phrases "tenpo pini" and "tenpo kama" are commonly used to mean "past" and
"future".

> tenpo pini la mi pali e ijo ike mute. -- I did a lot of bad things in the
> past.

> tenpo kama la o moku ala e kasi ni. -- In the future, don't eat this plant.

Of course, you can ask questions regarding time by using "tenpo seme":

> tenpo seme la sina pini e pali sina? -- When will you finish your work?
