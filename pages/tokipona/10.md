Time to introduce two another particles in this language: "pi" and "la".

## pi

The word "pi" works by grouping several adjectives together. Normally, all
adjectives in a phrase apply to the first word.

For example:

> jan wawa -- strong person

> jan wawa ala -- no strong people

If you need to say "weak people", you need to negate "wawa", but not "jan".
That's where "pi" comes in handy:

> jan pi wawa ala -- weak person/people ("of no strength")

It is also useful for phrases that use unofficial words.

> ma tomo Wasintan li ma tomo lawa pi ma Mewika. -- (the city of) Washington is
> the capital ("main city") of the United States.

## la

The word "la" allows to combine two sentences to form conditions and introduce
context.

> [sentence A] la [sentence B].

This translates to something like:

> If [sentence A], then [sentence B].

## Dialectal differences

> explaining certain ideas.

The official book, the "o kama sona e toki pona!" course and my personal style
differ on how to place punctuation in sentences that use "la".

The official book sometimes uses a comma before "la" and sometimes uses no
punctuation.

The online course doesn't use any punctuation.

I personally prefer using the comma after "la".
