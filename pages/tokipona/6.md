Before we discover a whole new type of words and new grammar, let's fill in some
blanks.

The word "en" lets one combine several subjects in one sentence: 

> mi en sina li moku. -- Me and you are eating.

Note that it is _not_ used to combine several verbs or objects.

The word "mute" allows to specify whether the subject (or object) is singular or
plural.

> jan utala mute -- many warriors

> mi mute -- we, us

Here are some example sentences:

> jan lili mute li lape. -- The children are sleeping.

> kulupu ni li pona mute. -- This community is very good.

> kiwen suli li pakala e tomo lipu. -- A big rock damaged the library ("house of
> books").

> mi pakala lili. -- I made a little mistake.

> ilo sina li kalama mute ike. -- Your instrument is making lots of bad noise.

The word "ni" is also used to create more complex sentences.

> jan lili toki e ni: sina pona. -- The child said that you're good.

There doesn't seem to be an agreement whether or not "en" can be used within
phrases that use the particle "pi" (will be explained later). In addition, Sonja
Lang herself said that using "en" to combine several objects is "not completely
wrong", but rather stylistically inelegant.
