## Numerals

The most basic numerals in toki pona are these words:

* ala - 0, nothing
* wan - 1
* tu - 2
* mute - 3 or more

This is, quite obviously, a very limited system. But it is not unique to toki
pona: languages from some hunter-gatherer societies stop their numerals at
three, two or even one. (In fact, the Pirahã language is reported to only have
had words for "small quantity" and "large quantity", the values of which change
based on context.)

However, there is also a second, additional system that is officially defined,
and commonly used, to describe larger numbers. It repurposes some of toki pona's
words as additional numerals:

* ala - 0
* wan - 1
* tu - 2
* luka (hand) - 5
* mute (many) - 20
* ale (all) - 100

In this system, words are added or repeated in order to form numbers. For
example, 42 is "mute mute tu" (20+20+2) and 18 is "luka luka luka tu wan"
(5+5+5+2+1).

As you can see, this is still a rather limited system. Just to name the year in
which this page was originally written (2020), it would require one to repeat
the word "ale" twenty times and add one "mute" at the end.

These limitations are all part of toki pona's philosophy of simplifying thought
and avoiding unnecessary detail. Some people have tried coming up with other
numeral systems, but none have found widespread acceptance.

## Using numerals

Regardless of the specific system, numerals are treated as adjectives and added
at the end of nouns or noun phrases:

> soweli wan -- one animal

> waso lili tu -- two small birds

For ordinal numbers (first, second...), the word "nanpa" followed by the number
is used.

> jan nanpa wan -- first person

> tomo nanpa mute luka luka wan -- 31st house (or house #31)

The phrase "nanpa wan" is sometimes used along with adjectives as a superlative
modifier:

> nena (Ewelesu/Somolunma) li nena suli nanpa wan lon ma ale. -- Mount
> (Everest/Chomolungma) is the largest mountain in the whole world.

## The calendar

In combination with "tenpo", the words "suno", "mun" and "sike" are commonly
used to describe periods of time:

> tenpo suno -- day ("sun time")

> tenpo pimeja -- night ("dark time")

> tenpo mun / tenpo sike mun -- month ("moon time / moon cycle")

> tenpo sike -- year ("circle time").
