these letters have consistent pronunciations. 

These are: a,e,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,s,t,u,w.

You might have noticed that all these letters are lowercase. This is because all

* **i** sounds like the "i" in the word "win".

* **o** sounds like the "o" in the word "long".

* **u** sounds like the "oo" in "oops" or "moon".

differences. For example, some might substitute the sounds "p,t,k" with "b,d,g".
