Prepositions are words that are attacked to other parts of the sentence in order
to express a place or time (more on that in the future) or a specific detail
about the action.

In toki pona, the words "kepeken", "lon", "sama", "tan" and "tawa" can be
prepositions -- in which case they're added at the end of the sentence without
any extra particles -- or as regular words with related meanings.

Here are some examples of all five of these words, both as prepositions and as
regular words:

> mi pona e tomo kepeken ilo mi. -- I am repairing the house using my tools.

> mi toki kepeken toki pona. -- I speak in toki pona.

> sina kepeken e ilo sitelen. -- You are using a writing/drawing tool (pen,
> pencil, brush).

> mi lon tomo sina. -- I am in your house.

> jan ike li kalama mute lon tomo lipu. -- A bad person is being very noisy
> in the library.

> ona toki e ijo lon. -- He/she/they speak the truth ("talk about things that
> exist").

> mi en sina li sama. -- You and I are similar.

> meli sama mi li pona. -- My sister is good.

> kiwen lili li sama lukin pipi. -- The pebble ("small rock") looks like a bug.

> mi tawa tan tomo mi. -- I am leaving my house.

> tomo tawa mi li pona. -- My car ("moving house/structure") is good.

> mi tawa lon tomo moku. -- I am going to the restaurant ("house of food").

The word "tawa" can also express perspective.
